	<h3>The continuation to greatness</h3>
	<p> This is you continuing which i find a little bit facinating because
	you made it this far and it is encouraging.<br />
	This is the testing of the in-line link to see if it will work. Please
	do well to visit <a href="yes/index.html">yes</a> page of the website. Please
	continue to browse through the pages of the website to enjoy its full
	content</p>
	<p>This part is about quotation and other parts of the semantic usage of
	text manipulation. There are basically two types of quotaion usage:</p>
	<p>This right here is the in_line quotaion usage: <q>It pays to be good
	 all the time and i concur</q></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>this type of qoutation makes use of the entire paragaph for 
		its quatation, which is actually <b>nice</b>.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p> The other usage of SEmantic usage is <i>actually very good</i> 
	, I hope you notice the italic usage. this is the <strong>Strong and 
	good usage</strong> along with the emphasis usage which is used in <em> 
	This way to emphasize</em> on a word in a sentence<br />
	This right here is the usage of the definition semantic sytle of text 
	usage <dfn>Semantic</dfn> is actually a type of text manipulation that 
	does not actually affect the structure of the text. this is <del>not 
	good</del> being replaced with <ins>good</ins>, which is just basically 
the usage of del & ins and dont forget the usage of <s>to strike out a line</s>. The use of Cite is also included in this section
	 <cite>The good old days</cite>.
